              <p>I had heard people tell a story like this: When a girl was taking a doctoral degree, she always worried that she couldn’t get it, and she was worried that her favorite tutor would not want her. At that time, her ex-boyfriend tried to comfort her: &quot;Dear You can't take a doctor; you are still a master, don't worry.&quot; She felt that her ex-boyfriend could not comfort her. Because she was still very anxious. Later, the demand that let the ex-boyfriend calm her anxiety is growing, and the boyfriend's &quot;incompetence&quot; is getting more and more dissatisfied with her. Finally, she chose to break up with her boyfriend.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Very interesting: Her husband is strikingly similar to her ex-boyfriend, but she doesn't feel any problem at all. She explained to us that the type of ex-boyfriend is very suitable for her, but he can't comfort her at the time. The reason is that she cannot appease her anxiety. When she finds herself capable of controlling her anxiety, it is no longer an obstacle in her intimate relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many times, we are like this, because we can't control our bad feelings, so look forward to other people's changes to make your mood better.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-do-we-want-to-control-others">Why do we want to control others?</h2>
<p>My mother is a person with a strong desire to control, and I am not a submissive child, so my &quot;young rebellious period&quot; looks much longer than other children. Until now, I have occasionally refused to react rebelliously in the first place, and then I realized in the next moment that I have just rebelled.</p>
<p>In fact, in 99.9% of the cases, she felt that she was doing it for me, but she did not realize that behind the control of &quot;good for me,&quot; there are <code>hidden deeper reasons</code>. Before the relationship between the two of us became very close, that is, during the two years that I gave up my civil engineering major to psychology, we revealed the worst side. That mother is almost crazy; she did not consider that I suddenly came to this big turn. At that time, she often called and said to me: &quot;Because of you, I lost sleep last night.&quot; Or &quot;Because you, I am sick again.&quot; Or &quot;If you don't turn professional, my mood will be much better, It won't be insomnia or anxious.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a very interesting thing that my mother is doing continuously: <code>she always wants to change her mood by changing me</code>. When she feels anxious, it is because &quot;I make her worry so much&quot;; when she feels angry, it is &quot;I make her angry&quot;; and when she feels depressed, it is because &quot;I let her down.&quot; Because she can't control her negative emotions, one of the things she likes most before is to call me and tell me: <code>Only when you change, my mood will be better</code>. Of course, I have always resisted this statement.</p>
<p>Just like my mother told me when I was a child, &quot;I also had a dream, because I gave birth to you and gave up my dream.&quot; <code>She made me responsible for her emotions and her life</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later, I began to understand slowly that when we were trying to control others, it was usually because of our unstable self and self-worth, which required others' language and behavior to be affirmed or comforted. So we want to control others: since I am because you have such negative emotions, and I cannot deal with this emotion, so you have to change so that my mood can get better!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found out that I was the same. I especially want to get the mother's affirmation when making decisions. If I don't get her affirmation, I will be very frustrated and complain to her: You have not given me confidence. Later, I found out that in most cases I was suspicious of myself, so when my mother objected to my decision rather than support, I would think she did not give me confidence. <code>If you don't believe in yourself, then you only have to force others to give affirmation, and then get the borrowed confidence</code>.</p>
