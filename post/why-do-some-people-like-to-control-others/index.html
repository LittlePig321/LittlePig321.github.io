              <p>I had heard people tell a story like this: When a girl was taking a doctoral degree, she always worried that she couldn’t get it, and she was worried that her favorite tutor would not want her. At that time, her ex-boyfriend tried to comfort her: &quot;Dear You can't take a doctor; you are still a master, don't worry.&quot; She felt that her ex-boyfriend could not comfort her. Because she was still very anxious. Later, the demand that let the ex-boyfriend calm her anxiety is growing, and the boyfriend's &quot;incompetence&quot; is getting more and more dissatisfied with her. Finally, she chose to break up with her boyfriend.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Very interesting: Her husband is strikingly similar to her ex-boyfriend, but she doesn't feel any problem at all. She explained to us that the type of ex-boyfriend is very suitable for her, but he can't comfort her at the time. The reason is that she cannot appease her anxiety. When she finds herself capable of controlling her anxiety, it is no longer an obstacle in her intimate relationship.</p>
<p>Many times, we are like this, because we can't control our bad feelings, so look forward to other people's changes to make your mood better.</p>
