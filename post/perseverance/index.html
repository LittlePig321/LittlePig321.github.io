<p>Too many children are declared to be the &quot;winner.&quot; They have felt  they are unique, and others have said how talented they are,  In this way, it becomes difficult for them to recognize and praise real excellence in some backgrounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are constantly open-minded and have a lot of things involved, you put too much energy into them, so there is no more energy to concentrate on any one thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not glad because we succeed in a certain area, and we succeed because we are already happy.</p>

<h2 id="an-age-of-lack-of-perseverance">An Age of Lack of Perseverance</h2>
<p>Young people born between 1980 and 2000 (millennial generations) are easily injured when they are judged and criticized by others. They do not have stronger self-esteem and responsibility than others and are more weak and narcissistic. In front of difficult tasks, they are always thinking about taking shortcuts.</p>
<h2 id="cultivate-fortitude-like-baking-cakes">Cultivate fortitude like baking cakes</h2>
<p><strong>1. Full of enthusiasm</strong></p>
<p>To be Perseverance, you must have enthusiasm. There are two types of enthusiasm, one is compulsive enthusiasm, and the other is harmonious enthusiasm. Compulsive enthusiasm makes you meditate, weakens your energy, and lets you ignore other important aspects of life. Its logo is an intrusive idea and difficult to control the impulse to do such a thing. Harmonious enthusiasm makes you happier and more intelligent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you feel no enthusiasm, even compulsive enthusiasm, you can try to develop in a certain interest, doing more than usual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2. Pursuit of happiness</strong></p>
<p>Happiness consists of Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement.</p>
<p><strong>3. Set goals</strong></p>
<p>People with true perseverance must be motivated by the goal because it is to &quot;storage&quot; their enthusiasm and energy.</p>
<p><strong>4. Self-regulation</strong></p>
<p>Try to control your attention.</p>
<p><strong>5. Be patient</strong></p>
<p>In this era, <code>instant gratification</code> has become the norm, because the path of exploration must be full of disappointment, delay, and possible failure. Therefore, people with true perseverance also need to cultivate patience virtues because they do not set short-term goals.</p>
<p><strong>6. Keep humble</strong></p>
<p>Humility on the social level refers to honesty, thoughtfulness, maturity, and selflessness; and humility on the intellectual level consists of curiosity, willingness to learn from others.</p>
<p><strong>7. Persist</strong></p>
<p>Improve your perseverance, for example, to list the three most difficult things that have been done that day.</p>
