<p>What is the cost of lies? It's not that we'll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all. What can we do then? What else is left but to abandon even the hope of truth and content ourselves instead with stories? In these stories, it doesn't matter who the heroes are. All we want to know is: who is to blame?</p>

<li>The occurrence of a tragic accident must contain many factors.</li>
<li>A lot of decisions are not made by the general public.

<p>Therefore, after the disaster, we cherish the people who have reduced disaster losses. What is the point of questioning the people and things at that time? Are we not more likely to learn from it?</p>
<p>33 years later, wildlife has turned Chernobyl, a &quot;human hell&quot;, into a paradise. There is no human, and nature is balanced. Human greed and selfishness undermine the natural balance.</p>
