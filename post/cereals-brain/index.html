              <p>In order to stay away from the disease, we follow the so-called  <code>healthy diet</code> to consume a lot of gluten and carbohydrates. However, brain and body diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and anxiety are still raging. Why does this happen?</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>The world's recognized authority on neurodegenerative diseases, Dr. David Permatt, MD, decades of clinical and laboratory research, and more than 30 years of experience. Through observation, uncover the surprising truth that wheat, carbohydrates, and sugar damage the brain and health.</p>
<p>Permatt tells you about the revolutionary healthy diet that is used by European, American, Hollywood and sports stars. A detailed four-week plan to help you change your daily habits, including food, exercise, and sleep. Get a flexible brain and a healthy body, even rewrite genes and prolong life.</p>

<h2 id="the-truth-of-the-whole-grain">The truth of the whole grain</h2>
<p><strong>1. What is the difference between our recipes and our ancestors?</strong></p>
<p>If you go back to the Old Stone Age, with our ancestors who talk about people's lives now, though they certainly do not know there are so many rich foods, But they are black and thin, and they certainly don’t know the chronic diseases of modern people - heart disease, diabetes, depression, immune disorders, cancer, and dementia. But as a species, we have the same genetic and physiological structure as they do. Looking at the recipes of our ancestors, how can such unhealthy recipes not have these diseases? It is unbelievable. Can we say that we are more suitable for the ancestral recipes?</p>
<p><strong>2. diabetes, insulin, Alzheimer's disease</strong></p>
<p>You know Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. What is the relationship?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most recent answer is that Alzheimer's disease is the third type of diabetes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glucose is the source of energy for the body's cells, but the cells are not absorbed by the glucose but are allowed to enter with the permission of insulin. Normal healthy cells are very sensitive to insulin and absorb smoothly; but if the sweets are eaten much, there is more glucose. <strong>When the cells take up too much glucose, they reduce the sensitivity to insulin</strong>. Over time, they develop into an insulin-resistant disease, so the pancreas has to secrete more insulin, which forms a vicious circle, eventually becoming type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycemia is like a piece of glass raging in your body, leading to blindness, infection, nerve damage, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. This is because the resistance of cells to insulin can cause the formation of brain plaques.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes tripled in the past 40 years; In the next 40 years, there will be 115 million people worldwide suffering from Alzheimer's disease, which will cost more than $1 trillion.</p>
<p>The authors list several possible causes of Alzheimer's disease: Diabetes; although not diabetes, but long-term hyperglycemia; <strong>eat too much carbohydrate; low-fat diet, intake of too little cholesterol,  gluten allergy problems. These factors are worthy of alertness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. gluten-a brain killer</strong></p>
<p>Maybe we know that celiac disease is a problem, but up to 40% of people can not properly digest gluten, and the remaining 60% may suffer but know nothing about it. And the correlation between gluten and nervous system disorders is increasingly being confirmed by more research. Many people have recovered from the gluten-free diet recommended by the author after there is no way to seek medical advice.</p>
<p>The root cause of brain disease is <code>inflammation</code>, and <strong>gluten and high carbohydrates are irritants of brain inflammation</strong>. Indigestion and food allergies are very easy to find, But when the brain is attacked at the molecular level, you don't feel it at all, but when you are diagnosed with dementia, everything is already late.</p>
<p>The author suggests that you need to break the current popular diet: low fat, high carbohydrates, low cholesterol. <strong>Cholesterol is significant for brain health</strong>, and several top studies have proven that total cholesterol levels and language fluency, attention, Abstract reasoning ability and cognitive level in multiple fields have a positive linear correlation. People with a high blood sugar level in their normal range have a high risk of brain atrophy. You can do a fasting insulin test. If it is high, you are already on the verge of diabetes, and it is very likely that the brain has been damaged.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-gluten">Understanding gluten</h3>
<p><strong>1. Delicious gluten, terrible gluten</strong></p>
<p>Gluten is a complex protein that acts as a binder to glue the grain into a powder. The soft, fluffy, and vigorous bread is the gluten's credit; fermented gluten is the key. Gluten is not only found in cereals such as wheat, rye, and barley, but also widely used in cheese, margarine, conditioner, and mascara.</p>
<p>Celiac disease is an extreme gluten allergy, with an estimated 1 in 30 people suffering from this disease, especially Nordic descent. As early as a century ago, doctors discovered that there was a link between celiac disease and neurological disorders, but they thought it might be that the intestinal absorption was not good enough to cause nutritional problems in the brain. Until the end of the century, the researchers found that patients with celiac disease were accompanied by a decline in cognitive function, and after stopping the gluten food, they slowly recovered. The researchers realized that gluten protein caused inflammatory factors, and the latter caused brain problems. Please see the following set of comparison charts.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://LittlePig321.github.io/post-images/1556179550591.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Keep in mind that <strong>gluten allergy increases the production of inflammatory cytokines</strong>, whether they are celiac or not, and these inflammatory cytokines are central to neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p><strong>2. Modern food gluten oversupply</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that the damage of gluten is so great, it is a miracle that our human survives to the present. The truth is that the grain we eat today were very different from the grain 10,000 years ago, In particular, our food chain has changed rapidly and radically over the past 50 years, and genetic engineering has enabled us to grow cereals that are 40 times more gluten than before.</p>
<p><code>Modern gluten-rich grains are more addictive than any previous grain</code>. Gluten can enter the stomach and become a peptide that crosses the blood-brain barrier, which binds to the brain's morphine receptors to produce a pleasant sensation. This thing called exorphin damages the brain. So you will be addicted to those chewy scones and croissants. It's not just because it tastes good, but your brain needs them.</p>
<p>You can see which of the following four foods makes blood sugar rise the fastest:</p>
<ul>
<li>a piece of whole wheat bread;</li>
<li>block snickers;</li>
<li>a spoonful of sugar;</li>
<li>a banana.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will choose the wrong ones in all likelihood. Their glycemic index is 71, 55, 68, 54.<code>The effect of wheat to raise blood sugar is more obvious than sugar</code>; you didn't think of it.</p>
<h2 id="is-modern-nutrition-science-scientific">Is modern nutrition science scientific?</h2>
<p><strong>How are you obese?</strong></p>
<p>Modern nutritional science tells you to speed up your metabolism, eat more carbohydrates, avoid fat and cholesterol. However, this nutritional theory has no cultural inheritance and evolutionary factors, and in fact, it does not make people more healthy. But a lot of advertising, weight loss advice, and popular books are all flaunting this idea.</p>
<p>Of course, there is scientific evidence that <strong>trans fatty acids are associated with many chronic diseases</strong>. But you need to know that <strong>healthy fats and cholesterol</strong> are good for your health. A lot of carbohydrates are the source of bad health. <code>Humans don't need carbohydrates, and the liver can provide the energy the body needs</code>. You have to know that eating fat is not add fat. In reality, obesity has nothing to do with fat intake but is closely related to carbohydrate addiction. The same is true for cholesterol, and eating high cholesterol foods has little effect on actual cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>In the past 2 million years, we have been eating a high-fat diet, and only after 10,000 years ago when agriculture was developed, carbohydrate foods were enriched. In 1962, the geneticist James • Neal Adams first proposed <code>thrifty gene hypothesis</code>, In the primitive society, human lack of food for a long time is a normal phenomenon, so when the food is rich, the fat is rapidly increased. When the food is lacking, the metabolic mechanism of the body is in a state of conservation, but it is difficult for modern society to have food famine. So the body sends out signals every day to increase fat synthesis and storage, which leads to the prevalence of obesity. But unfortunately, thrift genes have helped us through the long period of food scarcity, but now it has led to obesity. And the rate of genetic change is very slow. It takes about 40,000 years to make a significant change. At that time, maybe your body will not produce and store fat during the food-rich period.</p>
