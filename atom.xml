All we want to know is: who is to blame?</p>

<p>I happened to see an article introducing Anki last week. I suddenly had curious. So, I just want to make good use of this tool. First, download the software, then familiarize with the most basic functions of the software. I feel very good. Later I was thinking, I want to combine &quot;Aurora Word&quot;, &quot;Hundred Words&quot;, &quot;Anki&quot;, so I have the following video.</p>

At that time, her ex-boyfriend tried to comfort her: &quot;Dear You can't take a doctor; you are still a master, don't worry.&quot; She felt that her ex-boyfriend could not comfort her. Because she was still very anxious. Later, the demand that let the ex-boyfriend calm her anxiety is growing, and the boyfriend's &quot;incompetence&quot; is getting more and more dissatisfied with her.
